# CS-305
Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
I worked with Artemis Financial as our client. They addressed coding issues to improve software application security.


What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
I thoroughly examined the code to detect software security flaws, closing any security breaches. Secure coding prevents data breaches, unauthorized access, and cyberattacks. Software security protects sensitive data, maintains customer trust, and prevents financial and reputational losses, improving a company's health.


What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
The assessment's focus on security layers at different phases of software development was helpful. However, precisely identifying vulnerabilities and choosing the best mitigation methods was difficult.


How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
I added input validation, safe API interactions, encryption, and thorough code checks for security. I would examine vulnerabilities using automated vulnerability scanning technologies and manual code audits in the future. The severity of the vulnerability, its possible implications, and industry best practices would determine mitigation solutions.


How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
I rigorously tested the software's functioning and security. I used automated and human tests to find new vulnerabilities after code refactoring. This ensured software dependability and security after refactoring.


What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
I used static code analysis, human code reviews, encryption, and industry-standard secure coding methods. Future software security evaluation, vulnerability mitigation, and safe software development assignments might benefit from these tools and methods.


Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
Potential employers can see my thorough vulnerability evaluation, successful security implementation, and ability to change code for greater functionality and security. I can also demonstrate my expertise in industry-standard security standards, tools, and approaches for secure software development.
